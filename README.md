# String Manipulations and Problem Solving in Java

This repository contains Java implementations for various **String Manipulation** techniques, covering topics from basic to intermediate levels. The focus is on practical problem solving with topics such as palindromes, string performance, and substring manipulations.

## Topics Covered

- **Palindrome Check**: Determine if a string is a palindrome.
- **String Equality**: Using the `equals` method to compare strings.
- **Palindromic Substrings**: Identify all palindromic substrings within a string.
- **Performance Considerations**: Optimizing string operations for performance.
- **Reverse Words in a Sentence**: Reverse the words while preserving their order.
- **String Basics**: Understanding immutability, string manipulation, and key methods.
- **StringBuilder**: Using `StringBuilder` for efficient string concatenation.
- **String to Character Conversion**: Converting between strings and character arrays.
- **Substrings**: Extracting portions of strings efficiently.
- **Toggle Case in Strings**: Toggle the case of each character in a string.
- **Toggle Specific Characters**: Selectively toggle case based on conditions.

## Problems Solved

The following problems were solved as part of this learning:
- Check if a string is a palindrome
- Reverse words in a sentence
